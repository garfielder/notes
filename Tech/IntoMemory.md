# Looking Into Memory 

When talking about memory, people may think of DDR, GDDR, Memory, Chips, or some  picture below. 

However, there are much more story inside memory. Let's start from the very beginning

## Semiconductor 
What makes the conductivity of a material? It is the atrribute of the  [valence electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron#Electrical_conductivity).  For metal, it has fewer valence electrons compared with non-metal,  in solid state, it is relatively free to leave one atom in order to associate with another one nearby, so we have 'free electrons in metal, and thus make metal conductive
