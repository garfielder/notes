# Looking Into Memory 

When talking about memory, people may think of DDR, GDDR, Memory, Chips, or some  picture below. 

However, there are much more story inside memory. Let's start from the very beginning

## Semiconductor 
What makes the conductivity of a material? It is the atrribute of the  [valence electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron#Electrical_conductivity).  For metal, it has fewer valence electrons compared with non-metal,  in solid state, it is relatively free to leave one atom in order to associate with another one nearby, so we have 'free electrons in metal, and thus make metal conductive 

For insulator, it's [ionization energy] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_energy) is high, the electrons cannot easily leave the atom even when electric field is applied. 

For semiconductor such as silcon and germanium,  they have single crystal structure. Their conductivity is between metal and nonmeta ( resulator).  Such a aotm has four valance elctrons shared with its neighbours, so it is relatively stable at room tempature, when temprature,  its valance electrons get more energy so that it easily escap from where it belongs. 




## Diode and JFET
Magical things happen when introducing impurites into above crysital structure. There are N-type and P-type semiconductors.  Just as the names suggests,  N-type has more valance electrons while P types with more holes.
(see chapter 1 of <<electronic devices and circuit theory>>ã€€by Roylestad and Nahelshy)

A Diode is a juction of n-type and p-type  secmiconductor.

In the space charge region,  there is an internal e-field , if the external e-field is of the same direction, it makes the slice thicker, thus current is blocked.  Other wise, it makes current flows through the junction. 

Jnction gate  field-effect  transistor(JEFT)  is a three-terminal semiconductor devices that can be used as electronically-controled switches, amplifiers, or voltage-controlled resistors. 


See here for how it works:

By controlling the Vgs, we can control the conductivity between source and drain. 

MOS transistor is another kinds of FED (field-effect transistor) other than JFET.  There are NMOS and PMOS. See the link below for more:

CMOS is a *process technology* that contains both CMos and NMos transisor . It is not a name for a specific kind of transistor. 

## SRAM and DRAM

Both SRAM and DRAM are semiconductor storage. The minum storage unit is a CMOS transistor, also named memory  bit, several bits  consist a memory  unit. Data will be lost after powerdown.
