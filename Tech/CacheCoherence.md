# Cache Coherency
## Concept 
Concept from  计算机体系结构量化的研究方法
Cache coherence ensures that multiple processor see a consistent view of memory. <Br>
There are different discriplines for cache coherence. The strict it is, the more performance penaltiy there is: < br>
* Every write operation appears to occur instantaneously
* All processors sees the same sequence of changes of value for each separated oprand
##  Formal defination
* 
##  Cache Write policy 
* Write through
    * Wemory write is written into both cache and main memory. 
* Write back 
    * Memory writes eventually  goes into main memory
